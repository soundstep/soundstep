Hi there!

I’m diving into private projects, so most of my work isn’t visible here. I’m a Lead Engineer specialising in both front-end and back-end development and, as well as cloud infrastructure and CI/CD integrations. My focus is on enhancing team workflows and boosting productivity.

I’ve led an SRE team, built dynamic CI/CD pipelines, and created various CLI tools. I collaborate closely with other leads and directors to develop frameworks that support engineers and showcase the value of technical work. I’m also active in front-end communities, sharing knowledge and encouraging collaboration.

I enjoy scripting to simplify processes, and automation are integral to my daily routine. I’m passionate about tech and enjoy mentoring, improving systems, and driving innovation.
