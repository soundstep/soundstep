### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Currently hard working on private repos, you won't see most of my work!

I obviously like programming in general, that's why I'm here. I do like node.js and vanilla Javascript, barebone things, usually works for me as I believe "going towards simplicity" is an important mantra to have.

Without killing the fun, I follow some old concepts that Javascript developers seem to forget nowadays. Like the Law of Demeter, scalability, maintainability, well-used design patterns, and so on. For this reason I love frameworks, libraries, open source code and I believe in user friendly API, abstractions and well-built interfaces.

Beside that, I love scripting anything that will help myself, and probably some colleagues, regardless of the language: Javascript, NodeJS, Go, Deno, bash, Groovy, or anything that will work at that moment. I take scripting everyday's tasks as an excuse to learn new tools and new languages because I'm really really... curious!

Monorepos and a big accent on automation and workflows seem to be part of my daily life as a developer.

Get in touch, just for chatting!
